Game engine written in Unity for Look Mum No Computer's 8x6 Gameboy Megamachine display (later to be 8x8).

It simulates the Gameboy displays as well as outputting the appropriate midi notes to drive the actual display (16), mini-display (15) and machine itself (1).

Currently has Snake and Tetris.

Easy to add other games, just program your logic in a monobehaviour script and drive the pixels using ScreenController.
